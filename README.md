# decoupled-sectored-cache

This project is based on the implementation of flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator and its performance analysis using SPEC benchmarks. The project designs a flexible two-level cache which can be configured as basic cache and also as decoupled sectored cache. The basic cache configuration is nothing but the normal L1-L2 memory hierachy and the latter is where the L1 behaves as basic cache whereas the L2 behave as cache in decoupled sectored format.
